* Leader for C: Clayton Johnson

### Communication Rules
* Communicate over Slack
* Must respond within 24 hours, any emergency or dire situation should be communicated to the team ASAP

###Schedule Rules
* Leader will record goals and be final arbitrer.
* Goals will be decided at weekly meeting, voted upon, leader will be tiebreaker and have ultimate decision
* Weekly Meeting over Slack (Day and Time communicated via Slack before the fact)
* Leader will set deadline for everyone's piece of the assignment to be due by so the leader can do the rest of the organizational work in time for the class deadline.
* Everyone will meet this deadline unless they have a good reason to not meet the deadline.

### Work Progress Rules
* At least one other person needs to review a change-set that someone wants committed
* Work Items will be posted on a Trello Board
* Current Leader will check on progress of tasks assigned every Friday (end of week) and will assign tasks

### Evaluation Rules
